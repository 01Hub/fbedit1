FbEditMOD 1.0.7.8
    
    - all language files except NONE and german are currently broken
      (ENG is broken, please use NONE)
      addins should be recompiled before usage (include files has changed)
      activated addins are ready to go
        
    - [Edit]->[Elevator] moves caret lines up / down until same indent is found 
        maybe useful for navigating through large control structures
    
    - [Edit]->[History Paste] shows the clipboard history
        double clicking a pane will paste its content
        contents are editable before pasting
        use ESC to hide the window
    
    - [Edit]->[Backward]
    - [Edit]->[Forward] 
        caret movements to another line are logged
        moving around in this queue is done by ALT+LEFT / ALT+RIGHT
        scrolling line by line using UP / DOWN is not logged
        (not tested very well, i think there are some todos)
        
    - [Tools]->[Code Sniplets]    
        copying to clipboard instead into editor is now available
        
    - [Tools]->[Export properties]
        actual scope is shown in the dialogbox
        scope can changed using toolbar buttons in top of the property window
    
    - [Options]->[Code Editor]    
        editors linespacing can changed by adding "Extra 1/4 LFs" to optimize
        readability
        0 to 8 quarter LFs are selectable (will also work for HexEdit)
        color selection will also work for HexEdit
     
     - very important: fancy splash screen fade out
     
     - [Project]->[Project Options]->[Pre-Buildbatch | Post-Buildbatch]
        Now we can execute a batch files before and after each compiler run
        See example Projects\Samples\Pre_PostBuildBatch\Pre_PostBuildBatch.fbp for details
        If modules are compiled separatly, there are several environment variables updated
        before launching each batch (so the batch aware, which run is coming up)
        
     - [Project]->[Project Options]->[Module Handling]     
        if modules are compiled separatly, each module can have fbc commandline options for its own
        (perhaps you wanna use -gen gcc -O 2 not generally)
        Also you can translate several modules with other compilers (gcc, masm)
        See example Projects\Samples\MixedLanguage\MixLang_Demo.fbp for details
     
     - [Options]->[Environment]
        you can use nested expressions, they are resolved up to 5 levels, forwarding allowed
        e.g. greeting=%var1%, %var2%
             var1=hello
             var2=%target%
             target=world
        the variable %caret_word% can be used for starting up external help files
        see [Options]->[Help Menu]->MSDN-Library-2008 for an example howto startup 
        microsofts dexplore.exe
     
     - [Edit]->[Find]
        Regex is available now
        A nice help button shortcuts into FbEdit.chm
        Also there is a small library tool to collect your heavily used regular expressions
        Now we can search all bi-files in fbc's include path looking for an definition or whatever
        Find setting are stored in FbEdit.ini now, so they are not lost
        All the nice buttons are context sensitive enabled/disabled
        
     - Project explorer
        A project can contain more than one .rc-file
        The primary .rc-file MUST be marked as main file (red icon)
        Only the primary .rc-file is compiled
        The primary .rc-file has to include its childs via:   #include "second.rc"
                                                              #include "third.rc"
                                                              ...
        At the same time only one .rc-file can be opened in graphics mode, all the others are switched
        to text mode automatically                                                      
        
        now there is a "Scripts" section. Batch files inside can be started by doubleclick                                                      
                                                                
     - Output window has a new selector
        please click the vertical label on the left side of the output window to show/hide the selector
        the column sizes are stored in fbedit.ini, so they are not lost
        
     - Statusbar section 2 (LOCK/UNLOCK), 3 (LIN/BLK) and 4 (INS/OVR) is clickable   

     - Toolbar addin
        an error message is created, if the corresponding .bmp-file was not found

     - VKDebug
        a FbEdit version of VKDebug dumps directly to FbEdits output window
        now masm32/JWasm non-natives have some low level debugging support
        for details see Projects\Samples\MixedLanguage\

     - ResEd
        filespecs pointing to include or resource files are stored with relative pathes
        .rc-file relocation is easier to do now

     - (Untitled).bas / (Untitled).rc
        a full qualified path %TEMP%\(Untitled).bas[.rc] is assigned on creation
        so path aware autocompletes should work before saving
