FbEditMOD 1.0.7.8
    
    - all language files except NONE and german are currently broken
      (ENG is broken please use NONE)
      addins should be recompiled before usage (include files has changed)
      packaged addins are ready to go
        
    - [Edit]->[Elevator] moves caret lines up / down until same indent is found 
    
    - [Edit]->[History Paste] shows the clipboard history
        double clicking a pane will paste its content
        contents are editable before pasting
        use ESC to hide the window
    
    - [Edit]->[Backward]
    - [Edit]->[Forward] 
        caret movements to another line are logged
        moving around in this queue is done by ALT+LEFT / ALT+RIGHT
        scrolling line by line using UP / DOWN is not logged
        
    - [Tools]->[Code Sniplets]    
        copying to clipboard instead into editor is now available

        editors linespacing can changed by adding "Extra 1/4 LFs" to optimize

     - [Project]->[Project Options]->[Pre-Buildbatch | Post-Buildbatch]
        Now we can execute a batch files before and after each compiler run
        See example Projects\Samples\Pre_PostBuildBatch.fbp for details
        If modules are compiled separatly, there are several environment variables updated
        before launching each batch (so the batch aware, which run is coming up)
        
     - [Project]->[Project Options]->[Module Handling]     
        if modules are compiled separatly, each module can have fbc commandline options for its own
        (perhaps you wanna use -gen gcc -O 2 not generally)
        Also you can translate several modules with other compilers (gcc, masm)
