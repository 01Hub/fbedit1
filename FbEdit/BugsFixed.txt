Hi KetilO.
I'd like to pont out some minor things.
Operators and properties does not autocomplete and does not show in the function list.
Constructors and destructors autocompletes but does not show on the function list.
Other than that, it rocks!!!

I really like the option to put the cursor on the include file name and press Ctrl+O to open it. But it only works if the file is in the current directory tree. Here is an example:
#include "inc\includefile.bi"
This works okay if there is a folder in your current directory called Inc.
#include "fbgfx.bi"
This one doesn't work, because the file is in the compilers Inc folder, and the IDE doesn't check that folder unless that is where your current source file happens to reside.
** Comment: Thumbdrive, no compilerpath given.
** Fix: If no compiler path is given then application path is used.

This thing is really looking nice now. ;) I noticed an odd behavior though.
If I open a new code file, write some code that produces an error and run it,
FBEdit open up a new file after reporting the error.
** Fix: Quick Run does not attempt to open the file

'This makes the block folding stop at Function = -1
Function Test
        Select Case .Block(0)
        End Select
        Function = -1
End Function
** Fix: Dot treated as character in REM_ISLINE.
Edit2:
When adding a new function to the code, the IDE adds the line seperator immediately,
but when adding a sub the line only shows if you close and reload the file.
I really like working in your IDE so keep those updates coming =)
** Fix: Bug in WM_NOTIFY handling.
'Shows only Var1 in the auto complete list
Type Test
    As Integer Var1, Var2, Var3
End Type
** Fix: Modified parser.
'Here FB is a namespace. Auto complete shows ptr instead of Img
Type Test
    As FB.IMAGE Ptr Img
End Type
** Fix: Modified parser.
