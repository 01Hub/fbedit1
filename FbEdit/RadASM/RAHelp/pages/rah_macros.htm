<P>
Macros are used to record keystrokes and mouse movements and play them back. Use <B>Record Macro</B> from the <B>Macro</B> menu to begin recording, all keystrokes and mouse movements will be added until you press <B>Stop Recording</B> in the small dialog that appears. This uses a WH_JOURNALHOOK
hook function and is bound by the same limitations as that type of hook. When you are finished recording a Macro save dialog will appear, enter a name as you wish it to appear on the Macro menu, the macro name itself is auto-generated. When you wish to playback the macro, select it from the menu. To arrange your macro menu or delete macros use the <B>Manage</B> option, a dialog similar to the menu edit dialogs will appear.<BR>
