<p><b>WinErr</b> 2.014 by <b> QvasiModo</b> (Mario Vilas)<br>
07 Nov 03<br>
<br>
Provides a quick lookup of system error codes and their descriptions.<br>
You can look for decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers (preceded by "0x"), and equate names.<br>
The list of errors currently supported includes system errors (GetLastError API), Winsock errors (WSAEGetLastError API), and COM errors (as returned in EAX).<br>
<br>
There are two versions (completely independent from each other):<br>
    - WinErr.exe        Standalone version.<br>
    - WinErr.dll      	AddIn version (see below).<br>
<br>
The standalone version will store it's settings in WinErr.Ini, located at the same directory in wich WinErr.exe resides.<br>
<br>
You can load the WinErr addin under the following IDEs:<br>
    - AsmEdit, by Ewayne L. Wagner<br>
    - Chrome (formerly known as MAsmEd), by Franck Charlet<br>
    - QuickEditor, by Steve Hutchesson<br>
    - RadAsm, by Ketil Olsen<br>
    - WinAsm, by Antonis Kyprianou<br>

<hr>
<p><b>Integration with RadAsm (v2.0.3.0 and above):</b><br>
<br>
Copy WinErr.dll to your AddIns folder and install it using Addin Manager.<br>
To do it manually, add the following to the [AddIns] section of RadASM.ini:<br>
<br>
    n=WinErr.dll,x,1<br>
<br>
Where "n" is the next available addin number, and "x" is the option (0 to disable, 1 to enable).<br>
For earlier versions of RadAsm, the following entry must be added instead:<br>
<br>
n=WinErr.dll,x<br>
<br>
The settings will be stored in AddIns\WinErr.Ini.</p>
