<p>On the <b>Project</b> menu is a selection that allows you to delete minor
files. These are usually the working files that are created by the compiler that
are not necessary to the project. It can help limit size when packaging or
archiving your source if you leave out files such as the object file or res file
which are not necessary for a compile.</p>
<p>You can select the file extensions you want to delete by selecting <b>Set
Minor Files</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu and adding or removing files. You
can also have RadASM auto-delete the files after a build or prompt you to delete
them. If you do not select either auto-delete or prompt, you can use the Delete
Minor Files selection on the <b>Project</b> menu</p>

<p>The files and options set with this dialog are local to the currently open
project so you can have a different set of files to delete for each project.</p>
