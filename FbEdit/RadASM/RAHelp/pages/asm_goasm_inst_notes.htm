<p>The GoAsm support for RadASM uses a predefined directory structure in order to
get everything up and functioning correctly. The following directory structure is expected out-of-the-box, this can be changed to suit your
specific situation :</p>
<pre><b><font color="#0000FF">C:\GoAsm
    \BIN
            GoRC.exe
            GoAsm.exe
            GoLink.exe
            GFL.txt    - GFL is a text file that contains a list of DLLs
    \IncludeA
            Windows ANSI include files
    \IncludeW
            Windows UNICODE include files
    \Help
            Win32.hlp    - This file is an API reference see the <a href="faq_web_links.htm">Links</a> page</font></b></pre>

<p>The Windows ANSI and UNICODE include files can be obtained form the url in the <a href="faq_web_links.htm">links</a>
page.</p>
<p>Because of the fixed nature of command lines in RadASM the GFL.txt file is
used to list the API DLLs that a program will be using. Generally you would
include all of the DLLs that are available in the order that they are most used.
The GoAsm assembler uses this file as a reference when searching for API
commands. The default command line is based on project type and can be modified
on a project by project basis using <a href="rah_opt_proj.htm">Project
Options</a>.</p>
<p>The ANSI and UNICODE include files are a group of equates that convert
the API name from character set specific wrappers to a more generic form e.g. <b>
MessageBoxA</b> and <b> MessageBoxW</b> are both changed to <b>MessageBox</b>, pick the include
folder that supports the character set you wish to use. All of the API names
that require an ANSI or UNICODE suffix have been consolidated in a file called <b>all_api.inc</b>,
there is copy of the file in each of the include folders that is specific to the
selected character set.</p>
<p><b>#include &quot;C:\GoAsm\IncludeA\all_api.inc&quot;
</b>will include the ANSI version of API calls<b><br>
#include &quot;C:\GoAsm\IncludeW\all_api.inc&quot;
</b>will include the UNICODE version of API calls </p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF"><a name="newgoasm"></a>Limitations (v2.0.3.7):</font></b><br>
Because the entry point must be specified on the command line the following
defaults have been chosen:</p>
<p>Win32 (all types) : <b><font color="#FF0000">Start<br>
</font></b>DLLs : <font color="#FF0000"><b>DllEntryPoint</b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">New to v2.0.3.7</font></b>, for FRAME to collapse correctly you must
not specify the procedure name in the
ENDF statement . Earlier implementations required that the ENDF statement be
preceded by the procedure name, that is no longer the case. The USEDATA
statement is now collapsible as well. These changes were made to conform more
closely to the specifications in the GoAsm documentation.</p>
