<P>.OBJ files (COFF) are the preferred output for any assembler that you wish to use with RadASM. By assembling your program to the intermediate COFF format, RadASM has control over the link process and can add resources to the final executable. The resource tools in RadASM are very powerful and it is recommended that you always compile to obj then link your project to obtain an executable.<BR>
