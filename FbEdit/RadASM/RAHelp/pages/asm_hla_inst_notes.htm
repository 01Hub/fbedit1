<b><font color="#0000FF" size="5">HLA Installation notes</font></b></p>
<p>Randall Hyde's HLA is fully supported by RadASM. The setup is standard and
included in the <a href="rah_assembler_ini.htm">hla.ini</a> file. The only thing of
note is that RadASM expects to find the MASM executables in the \MASM32\BIN folder and HLA in
\HLA, if you have changed these locations you must set the <a href="rah_opt_paths.htm">paths</a>
accordingly.</p>

<p>It is very important to set up the environment variables needed by HLA. For
details of their setup refer to the HLA installation guide.</p>

<p>For Windows 95, 98 and ME add the following lines to the <b><font color="#FF0000">end</font></b> of autoexec.bat<br>
<br>
<b>set lib=c:\hla\hlalib;%lib%<br>
set hlainc=c:\hla\include<br>
set hlalib=c:\hla\hlalib\hlalib.lib<br>
set path=c:\hla;%path%</b></p>

<p>For Windows 2000 and Windows XP environment variables are set differently. Right-click on <b>My Computer</b> and select <b>Properties</b>,
from the <b>Advanced</b> tab select <b>Environment Variables</b> and add new
system variables with the names and values specified above.</p>
