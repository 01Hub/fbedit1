<P>There are times when you get to a point in a project where you must add a file. These functions are handled in the <B>Project</B> menu. The <B>Add New </B>menu item in the <B>Project</B> menu gives you several types of files to add. In cases where you add a resource such as a menu the necessary #include is made to the main RC file. You can also access the Project menu by right clicking in the Project box.
When added the file will be placed in the <b>Added Files</b> group, to change
the group that it is in or create new groups use the <a href="rah_opt_groups.htm">group
editor</a>.
</P>

<P style="border: 2 solid #008080"><B><font color="#FF0000">TIP</font>:</B> When opening a project it is possible to have files loaded automatically. Just right click on the file in the project box and select <B>Auto Load</B>, when the project is opened the file will be loaded as well.</P>
