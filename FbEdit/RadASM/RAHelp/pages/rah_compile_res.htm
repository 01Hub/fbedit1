<P>
If you choose to manually compile your RC file you can do this by selecting <B>Compile RC </B>from the <B>Make</B> menu. In order for the resources to be included in your program you will have to link them by selecting <B>Link</B> from the same menu. If either of these menu options are disabled you can enable them in <B>Project Options</B> that is found in the <B>Project</B> menu. It is advisable to let RadASM compile your resources by adding a <B>,4</B> to the end of the Link command line in Project Options. There are some cases where it may be necessary to compile the file yourself however, such as if you manually make a change to an RC file.<BR>
