Text links are small reminders that RadASM will add to your program source. There are three types of text links; <B>Notes</B>, <B>Bugs</B> and <B>ToDos</B> their purposes are self-evident. RadASM will insert a comment line in your code and a matching entry in your accompanying text file for you to keep track of various items during the coding process. The text links are added from the <B>Project</B> menu.<BR>
