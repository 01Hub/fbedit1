Digital Photo Frame.
--------------------

I recently bought a digital photo frame and soon discowered two problems.

1. The filesisze of my photos is huge and takes up a lot of unneccessary space on the memory card.
2. The width / height ratio from my pocket camera does not match, leaving portraits with the top of
   their head chopped off. I am really not that bad a photographer. My professional camera has the
   correct ratio but the filesize is huge.

To solve this problems I made this program to scale and size the pictures.
It converts jpeg pictures found in the source folder (including sub folders) and puts them in the
destination folder. The files is renamed to Imgxxxxx.jpg.

If you know the resolution of your digital photo frame, then you should change the PIXWT and PIXHT
constants and rebuild the project.
