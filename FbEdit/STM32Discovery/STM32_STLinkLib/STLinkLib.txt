STLink
------
Unfortunatly STLink documentation is scarce.
Sources for a linux STLink can be found here: https://github.com/whitequark/stlink

This made it possible for me to create a library that makes it easy to connect
to the STM32 Discovery board and read or write internal ram. This is great when
using the STM32 Discovery as a thin server and my PC as a fat client.

The library needs STLinkUSBDriver.dll to work.
