** Bugs in RAResEd
** Fixed: When saving a resource file (with exporting the names into rsrc.bi), the combo box above the property table loses all its entries and contains just one meaningless entry named "#define".
** Fixed: Editing the XP manifest in the resource editor or changing the filename doesn't work as expected, the changes are not saved. 
** Fixed: Writing RCDATA in resource editor and then deleting some parts of it causes FBEdit to add garbage data at the end so it won't compile. 
** Fixed: The resource editor displays scrollbars around all its child dialogs which let you scroll them away, which is senseless. 
** Fixed: The resource editor sometimes destroys menus when adding/deleting items in the middle of it. I can't tell you the cause exactly. 

** Bug in FbEdit
** Fixed: Deleting custom resource types doesn't work. 
** Fixed: Clearing the "Filter" field of custom resource types doesn't work, neither does adding one with a clear "Filter" field. 
** Fixed: When pressing backspace while typing a #include file name, the auto-completion box disappears and doesn't reappear until deleting and re-typing the first doublequote. 
** Fixed: The auto-complete box doesn't handle With blocks inside Namespaces correctly. 

And when you modify the Options->Helps Menu, it still doesn't re-save the path in .ini, so you loose your help path ...
